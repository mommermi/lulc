# Land-use/land-cover classification from satellite imagery

This repository contains an example Notebook to perform land-use/land-cover classification based on Sentinel-2 imagery. Three methods are compared against each other: thresholding, clustering (unsupervised learning) and neural networks (supervised learning).


The Notebook can be readily accessed via the following launchers: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/mommermi/lulc/main?filepath=segmentation.ipynb) [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/mommermi/lulc/blob/main/segmentation.ipynb)
